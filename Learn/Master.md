    ### First year
    
    Look like interesting courses
    
    ![Untitled](Master/Untitled%203.png)
    
    ### Second year
    
    Specialization in distributed systems and data mining for big data

    Data scientist paesi bassi 58k - PIL pro capite $52k
    
    ### First year
    
    Sounds a bit Formentini with that “process”, look at second year’s description.
    
    ![Untitled](Master/Untitled%204.png)
    
    ![Untitled](Master/Untitled%205.png)
    
    ### Second year
    
    Does not sound as interesting as KTH, sounds a little bit more abstract with Formentini at the beginning and cool technology not applicable anywhere in the middle.
    
    They focus on process instead of general data, for instance they have process mining instead of data mining. Should check if it's like Formentini.
    
    Exams are a bit general with only process mining going into depth.

    ### First year
    
    Not bad at all. Exams sound interesting but there is mandatory data mining that I may want to do the second year and supervised methods already seen.

    ![Untitled](Master/Untitled%208.png)
    
    ### Second year
    
    Does not follow a path and has widespread courses. I'm afraid they repeat a lot of things and they don't go in details.

    ### Second year
    
    Sounds a bit more generic than Eindhoven but there is no Formentini and we need to specialize on some type of data.

Twente vs Eindhoven: *Living is an important factor and that is here i found Uni Twente to be best. They are the only university in NED to provide on campus housing facility in a massive massive scale. I lived on campus in Enschede at Uni Twente and a had an amazing experience. Eindhoven is a very dry and kind of ugly place to live. Without a proper housing facility for students it can get difficult to socialize and make new friends.*
