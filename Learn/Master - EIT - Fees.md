Twente vs Eindhoven: *Living is an important factor and that is here i found Uni Twente to be best. They are the only university in NED to provide on campus housing facility in a massive massive scale. I lived on campus in Enschede at Uni Twente and a had an amazing experience. Eindhoven is a very dry and kind of ugly place to live. Without a proper housing facility for students it can get difficult to socialize and make new friends.*
